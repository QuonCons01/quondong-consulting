    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
      Quondong Consulting is a Northern Territory–based advisory service specialising in regional development, service improvement and community‑focused strategy. We work with organisations to strengthen capability, improve outcomes and support long‑term, locally driven change.

His background spans executive roles in the Northern Territory Government, local government, health, community services and ministerial advisory positions.

    <p>
      With qualifications in Social Work, Applied Management and specialist training across governance, emergency operations, natural resource management and incident planning, John offers a rare blend of strategic insight, operational capability and deep regional understanding.

      His strengths in collaboration, stakeholder engagement, strategic planning and culturally informed practice ensure clients receive practical, high‑impact solutions grounded in real‑world experience and regional insight.
    </p>

    <h2>Grounded in Country</h2>

    <p>
      Our work is shaped by the landscapes, communities and cultures of Central Australia and the Barkly. We recognise the importance of place, relationships and lived experience in designing approaches that are realistic, respectful and sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
      We bring a calm, steady presence to complex environments—listening carefully, engaging widely and working with you to turn ideas into practical, achievable steps.
